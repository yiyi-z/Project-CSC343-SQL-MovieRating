# Movie Rating Study
Term project for CSC343 using PostgreSQL

Hilda Wang and I worked together on this project :)

## What is this project about?
Our goal in this project is to find some factors that affect movie ratings.

We decided to investigate three factors: the experience of the producing team, financial support, and movie genre.

## How to see the result?
At the [sql_files_and_datasets](https://github.com/yiyi-z/Project-CSC343-SQL-MovieRating/tree/main/sql_files_and_datasets) folder, run "\i queries-runner.txt" after connect to a PostgreSQL database server.

You can also see our [report](https://github.com/yiyi-z/Project-CSC343-SQL-MovieRating/blob/main/documentation/3-Investigation%20Process%20and%20Result.pdf) for more details about how we get to result.

## Phases of the Project
All the documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/yiyi-z/Project-CSC343-SQL-MovieRating/tree/main/documentation).

### Phase 0

We made an [proposal](https://github.com/yiyi-z/Project-CSC343-SQL-MovieRating/blob/main/documentation/0-Project%20Proposal.pdf) for our project.

We chose the domains, came up with questions, found datasets and made proposal schemas.

### Phase 1

We made some [design changes](https://github.com/yiyi-z/Project-CSC343-SQL-MovieRating/blob/main/documentation/1-Design%20Changes.pdf) after knowing more about our datasets.

### Phase 2

We cleaned our datasets to fit our schemas and specifications.

The cleaning process and sample cleaned data are recorded [here](https://github.com/yiyi-z/Project-CSC343-SQL-MovieRating/blob/main/documentation/2-Data%20Cleaning.pdf).

### Phase 3

We wrote the schema and specification, and used queries to investigate our questions, and based on the results, we came up with follow-up questions and use queries to answer those questions.

The results and the process are recorded [here](https://github.com/yiyi-z/Project-CSC343-SQL-MovieRating/blob/main/documentation/3-Investigation%20Process%20and%20Result.pdf).
